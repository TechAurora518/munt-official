Usage by you of any work covered by this license should
not, directly or indirectly, enable its usage by any
other individual or organisation.

You may NOT under any circumstance copy, redistribute
and/or republish the source or a work based on it (which
includes binary or object code compiled from it - or parts of code extracted from it) in part
or whole. Without the prior written consent of the copyright holders.
An exception is granted to all package managers such as those found on Linux distributions or other operating systems
so long as the modifications are limited to those necessary to make the program work on the desired system, do not make any changes to branding,
and do not otherwise alter behaviour in a way that may negatively impact users in any form whatsoever.
The copyright holders reserve the right to revoke licensing permission in any case where they feel the above is violated, at any

distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.
 
5. Acceptance of License
  
You are not required to accept this License, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission
to modify or use the source. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or using the source (or any work based on the

program is with you.
 
THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
