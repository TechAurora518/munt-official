Contributing to Gulden
============================

Want to contribute to Gulden? There are many ways you can contribute, see below.

Opening issues
--------------------

Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features. 
Note please first check for existing issues before reporting new ones; and ideally check with the slack support channels that your issue is legitimate.

Contributing code
---------------------------
Code contributions are always welcome, simply submit a pull request for it to be reviewed. For larger changes first check with the developers and Gulden community whether the changes are ones that fit the vision of the project and are not already being worked on by someone else, to avoid dissapointment and/or wasting your time.

Keep your pull requests as clean as possible, don't mix multiple issues into one request, don't make unnecesssary formatting or name changes that make the patch larger than it needs to be, these can rather be split into multiple requests.

View [the developer guidelines](./doc/developer_guidelines.md) for basic code style standards andsuggestions.


Localisation/Translation
-----------------------

Improvements/additions to the localisations are always welcome, however please don't modify the .ts files directly - the correct place to participate in translation is our translation portal translate.gulden.com
Discussion around translation can be had in the #translate channel on our slack.
