Developer tools
---------------------

This directory contains various scripts that are not a core part of the repository itself, but aid developers with working with maintaining the repository, or building the repository for specific configurations and so forth.



Settings
---------------------
### private.conf.example ###

All developer tools scripts make use of a single configuration file 'private.conf' in which developer specific settings/preferences can be set. 'private.conf' is included in .gitignore to prevent accidental commit to the repository.
'private.conf'example' serves as an easy reference of all possible options that can be set, new developers can copy this to create 'private.conf' and then alter options as needed. When adding new options to scripts please also add them to 'private.conf.example' to keep it complete.
